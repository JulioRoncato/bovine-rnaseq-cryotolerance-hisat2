# 🧬 RNA-seq–Based Variant Calling in Bovine Embryos with Differential Cryotolerance

This repository contains a complete bioinformatics workflow for variant calling from RNA-seq data generated from bovine embryos with contrasting cryotolerance phenotypes. The project focuses on identifying genetic variants located in expressed regions and investigating the biological pathways impacted by genes harboring these variants.

This analysis was developed as part of my Master's research in reproductive and developmental biology with an emphasis on functional genomics and bioinformatics.

# 🔬 Biological Background

Embryo cryotolerance is a critical determinant of cryopreservation success in bovine assisted reproduction. Differences in post-thaw survival have been associated with molecular mechanisms involving cellular stress response, mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, membrane stability, and signaling pathways.

By integrating RNA-seq–based variant calling with functional enrichment analysis, this project aims to highlight genetic variants in transcriptionally active genes that may contribute to differences in embryo cryotolerance.

# 🧪 Experimental Design

RNA-seq data were obtained from bovine embryos classified into two experimental groups:

Group	Description:

* High Cryotolerance	Embryos with high post-thaw survival

* Low Cryotolerance	Embryos with low post-thaw survival


Variants were identified from RNA-seq alignments and subsequently mapped to genes to enable functional interpretation.

# ⚙️ Bioinformatics Workflow Overview

The analysis integrates Linux-based processing, variant calling, and R-based downstream analysis:

# 1️⃣ RNA-seq Alignment (Linux)

Quality-controlled RNA-seq reads were aligned to the Bos taurus reference genome using HISAT2, a splice-aware aligner suitable for RNA-seq data.

The --dta option was used to optimize alignments for downstream transcript- and variant-aware analyses.

# 2️⃣ Alignment Processing

SAM files were converted to BAM format using SAMtools

BAM files were sorted and indexed to enable efficient variant calling

# 3️⃣ Variant Calling from RNA-seq

Variants were called directly from aligned RNA-seq BAM files using bcftools

Resulting variants were stored in VCF format

This approach captures variants located in expressed genomic regions

# 4️⃣ Variant Filtering and Gene Mapping (R)

Variant data were imported and processed in R

Variants were filtered based on basic quality metrics

Genes harboring variants were extracted for downstream analyses

# 5️⃣ Functional Enrichment Analysis

Genes containing variants were subjected to pathway enrichment analysis

KEGG and Gene Ontology (GO) databases were used to identify biological pathways and processes associated with cryotolerance-related genetic variation

# 🧠 RNA-seq–Based Variant Calling Considerations

- Variant calling in this project was performed using RNA-seq data rather than whole-genome sequencing. As such:

- Only transcriptionally active regions are represented

- Coverage varies according to gene expression levels

- Splice-aware alignment (HISAT2) is essential

- Allele-specific expression and transcript structure may influence variant detection

- Despite these limitations, RNA-seq–based variant calling is well suited for identifying functionally relevant variants in expressed genes, particularly in the context of developmental and physiological phenotypes such as embryo cryotolerance.

# 📊 Downstream Analyses and Visualization

The project includes visual summaries such as:

* Distribution of variants across genes

* Comparative analyses between cryotolerance groups

All figures generated by the pipeline are available in the figures/ directory.

# 🔐 Data Availability and Reproducibility

Due to data confidentiality and ethical constraints, the datasets provided in this repository are simulated or derived from representative structures of the original data.

All scripts accurately reproduce the analytical workflow, ensuring transparency and reproducibility while protecting sensitive biological data.
